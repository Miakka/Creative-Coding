wake up in his bed whoa that just happened i m ok with it i think in fact on the way home i feel liberated great that s over that was it it didn t even really hurt i feel ok but what if anything will i say to my friends how ti explain it so they understand and don t chastise me the whole time i mean yes it was stupid but i don t regret it i wish it could have happened under better circumstances mainly sober but i trust brian and i feel ok so i don t know instead i debate birth control and whether or not i m a virgin anymore then it s to midtown where an asian woman pokes around at my vagina and removes every last hair every single hair she s very pleased i didn t scream and i m just glad she didn t wax the clit get toes did then meet brian at le pain quotidien eat head to union square where we wonder the farmers market then i get sleepy and we decide to head back to my place one surprising thing about last night is the lack of guilt i don t in any way feel guilty just a little different we try to watch a movie at my place but in the end we re back on my bed avoiding sex cause i can t do it again last night was grea but it was 10 days for crying out loud 10 days save something for the honeymoon for the record he says that s the fastest he s ever had sex with a girl which makes me feel both special and like a hoe so instead we nap wake up talk about many things i pack intermittently but by 1am he puts his foot down and helps me get to business telling me how to sort my clothes it helps and i pack fast and organized under his watchful eye we nap for a bit him frisky in his sleep as always hands rovving saying that he s horny and that he s falling in love then my car comes at 4 30am and i m gone to miami and my first time in 11 days without him miami i am on a plane but not feeling it the crowds the heat the high heels i miss my boo but there i am in miami alone waiting for the hotel shuttle nearly 2 hours later it s a no show so i share a cab with some kountray neegros from virginia they re all very friendly excited asking me about reality tv and such then i m at the catalina our rooms not ready so i change into a swim suit in the bathroom and hit the strip looking for a new bikini why because i m emotionally shopping i m alone i miss my boo and it s not even that sunny i find a cute one on sale for 40 string bikini who knew then i m on the beach it s cloudly overhead and i need to sleep seeing as i didn t get much last night nor on the cramped plane keysha arrives and i m happy to see her i catch her up on my tumultuous life and she guesses i m having sex i mean ya ll don t have jobs and it s free ya ll fuckin keysha she be knowin lol so then we head back to the hotel to check out the room it s a dump ugly dingy white and stinky i am 25 years old with my own bills to pay this is unacceptable so we get on the phones calling texting looking for a new hotel the people at the front desk aren t helpful at all not to mention all the airport drama tamra and lauren are going through i contemplate just going back to nyc this feels like a bust but somehow we all meet up and it s better and find a better hotel and my mood is lifted in our new hotel room i break the news to tamra and lauren lauren cries that girl so emotional wants to know why i didn t tell her the instant it happened crazy we eat at fatburger across from the hotel chelsea which is surprisingly delicious talking laughing then we go to the room to change head to wet willies it s whack the drinks are nasty clearly i m growing up we walk washington for a while then exhausted from a rough day head back to the hotel to sleep first real day at the beach we get up get some food then lay out play in the water meet some gay dude the beach isn t really popping but we re having fun then it starts to rain and then it stops we go back to the hotel nap dress and change for the night we go to the same mexican spot for the previous night i m hungry and a lil annoyed missing my boo we walk around looking for trouble to get into but then eventually settle back into bed oh well last real day in miami 4th of july i m looking for trouble to get into anything we get brunch and i m feeling crunk my energy is back on the beach we play in the water again then keysha helps me to go find a shark tooth necklace for brian we find one then another that s much better a maco shark s tooth from the peace river he will love it we eat even more mexican food then back at the hotel to change for the night meet up with chris he s talking crazy per usual a pimp in his own mind then i try to nap but it doesn t work so we re up again meeting with a bachelor party of downlow gay men in a cab to the strip club we drinking mood improving it s a hole in the wall bar with worn and naked women it s arousing and disturbing they dance lazily on the pole against each other on these gay men who we know secretly really ain t interested i don t know where to look it all seems so personal and odd and sad a little these girls ain t making no money and they dancing like they rather be doing their taxes but we getting drinks for free and i m getting drunk i go to the bathroom and when i come back there s a girl grinding on lauren oh shit lauren grinds back she will not be shown up it s crazy too much for me i can only laugh and avert mine eyes then it s a cab to a club back on the strip they buy a table and i m drunk dancing like i m janet a shot of patron i m in the zone drunk texting brian telling him to buy condoms crazy finally around 4 am we wind down and back into bed but not before getting into a hitting match with lauren for trying to take pictures of me in my sleep got to love friends wake up still drunk last night was wiiiiiiiiillllllld washing and redo hair cause i want to look cute for the boo wait for the shuttle with lauren at chesterfield get one last sandwich from la sandwhicherie and a bomb ass smoothie then i m alone at the airport alone on the plane talking to god sorting it all out what i need to do focus on i m leaving my church and i m sad mostly because i feel like a quitter but you got to know when to hold em when to fold em and i think that it has run it s tenure though not going back makes me sad going back makes me nervous and my stomach hurt i fear being judged not being good enough dedicated enough and never really considered why i wanted to join besides just wanting to sing and coincidentally i started my job around the same time i joined choir and had the same goals 1 year mark and then they both ended around the same time i take that as a sign so we land and i feel better and more importantly excited to see brian so i head home drop my stuff then head to his apt hes in the kitchen cooking listening to music at first it s a tiny bit awkard i haven t seen him in a while don t know what ot do with my body arms legs limbs but we figure it out settle into a steaming plate of veggies and potatoes he says prayer thanking god for me then we dig in it s good and for someone who claims not to cook i have him cooking often lol with sparkling white wine i give him the shark tooth lol this fool feels it through hthe bag before opening like it s exactly the one i want it s pretty darn close and he loves it so then we re back i the bedroom tipsy listening to robin thicke and eating strawberries he s so romantic if it wasn t me i might puke rubbing strawberries and licking then he s on top pushing it in pressure but it doesn t hurt then the condom i don t really feel a difference at all he s pushing deep fast and i m so surprised how much it doesn t hurt and how good it feels i can t help but smile cheesing really i am having sex and enjoying it crazy but it s still overwhelming and you probably shouldn t be sexing me if my stomach is gaseous and i feel like i m going to fart plus its just so overwhelming me having sex with brian what the fuck he flips me hits it from behind what has my life and language become then back around we rest for a bit condom off but per usual i m still wet this still excites him and he s back at it no condom push a bit then he s out rub tug and nut on my chest again what is my life but it was what it was and for what it was it wasn t bad but still confusing i like him but the love isn t there not yet too soon more mental barriers to overcome all these negative stereotypes i have about sex cloud my ability to judge what i want and what i m willing to give up or what i feel i m giving up or what it means and who wins i wake up the next morning to blood in the toilet hymen or period i find a pad and blood stains on the sheets as well it s anyone s call separating it all out lights from darks tumble dry air dry bleach or no separate neat little piles categorized by levels of importance relevance urgency trying to make it make sense so i can figure out what do to and how i ended up here it s like someone flipped a switch life rolling down on me incessantly wave after wave washing up on me my arms flailing trying to stay afloat i should learn to lay out on my back stop fighting it so much but that s hard to do it s rocking me the waves knocking against me and for some strange reason rick ross maybach music is consoling me or at least distracting me from what i ve seen the reality of the situation they re in so deep he on the phone yelling pacing i can hear her on the other end yelling and i m just sitting there frozen i don t want to hear it i don t know what to do it s ugly i shouldn t be witness to this or maybe i should the gravity of what i ve gotten myself into that i thought i d be perfect he was perfect we were perfect it s a sham he s in deep shit and i don t know if i want that not to mention that i have this habit of trying to make someone else s situation life better i m a fixer i want to impact your life improve it leave a mark that can t be erased but then that leaves no room for me and my faults and my problems i become the shoulder with no head taking on their own problems unevenly yoking the situation it was ugly he yelling about her calling him a faggot not being able to see his son yelling about getting the therapist involved yelling yelling circling back to unrelated topics just to yell some more accusations of abuse yelling i don t want to see you i don t want to be around you i m over this circle back yell some more i sat quietly at first unsure of what to do but as the yelling continued on i saw they were both hurt people yelling to win an unwinable battle and most annoyingly it didn t have anything to do with max they were just hurt people yelling at a wall the unstoppable force against the unmovable object yelling and getting no where and i got tired i didn t want to see it shouldn t have had to see it i don t want to be involved don t want to take sides don t want to give advice i don t want it so i moved to leave got my shoes on very slowly stood in the bathroom for a minute looking in the mirror and wondering what i had gotten myself into i didn t want to see him couldn t look at him i don t want it couldn t speak because there was nothing to say as i slowly moved to leave they wrapped the argument i m sorry kia he says in a noncommittal way i say nothing he says it again more earnestly to my face i say nothing i m not going to tell him it s ok make him feel better it was wrong he fucked up and i m not going to sugar coat the facts just writing it makes me tired there s been so much so much i can t maybe i m shutting down i don t want to but at the same time their situation is so unresolved so half baked my heart just can t open up to those odds it s like jekyll and hyde with him and i can t fall for half a person but i have a hard time resolving and accepting the other half i need sleep to wake up and understand what happened and what to do so it got better even though i woke up and still didn t want to see him i let him come over anyway told him how i felt how he was wrong for letting me see them fight and how he s still emotionally involved he said i was right and it was something he needed to hear and so i needed to get out reset breathe fresh air to lift the weight so we head down to the les to think coffee where we sip coffee and eat a cookie talk i love to listen to him talk how he thinks about things because i agree so much but he says it in a ways that s intriguing thoughtful depthful we talk about us why it works what we want i briefly squirm at the notion that he used to be shallow and to a certain extent he still cares about those things albeit from a health perspective but i have to remind myself i like me i think im attractive and if he wants to end it because i m not his ideal well then good riddance then we talk about my career and he gets on my case rightfully so that i need to be aggressive about what i want that he s going to hold me to it whatever it is that i want to do that he d moved to san francisco if i got a job out there he s determined stern it s only a little bit annoying mostly because how right he was and now i have someone to hold me accountable we talk talk talk time slipping away and then it s 7pm stop at whole foods then head to his apt while i m in the kitchen prepping food and talking to mom sandra he s on the phone apologizing the convo lasts longer that he guessed it was and i try not to get all tense about it you know i m always looking for someone to leave me for it to end but alas all we got is now so we eat him serenading me to rochelle ferrell and will downing duets which is hilarious and sweet it s late like 10 and i can t sleep cause my stomach s rumbling so i sit up and read while he curls on his side naked mumbling i love you in his sleep shit i ve been slacking on writing so much my days are melding and i m not sure where i am in the week i guess yesterday i slept crappy had gas paranoid of bug bites lay thinking about things to cook jobs to apply for and brian spoons me tells me he loves me goes into deeper sleep finally the sun is up we part ways bound for the gym i don t want to really go i m sleepy but i need to get back on course so i m there sweating through my boring abs routine then puffing it out on the treadmill for 30 on a 1 incline whoopee back home there s so much to do pay bills settle things look for jobs apartments i don t really accomplish much instead watching mj s funeral and falling asleep up brian calls he sounds a little short but comes over anyway i m a little short too but i know whenever we hang out it gets better so he comes over we re both very hungry eat the leftovers he s still hungry so we go to society where i have dessert and coffee he has a sandwhich we talk and it always turns me on his brain brilliant on the bus ride home i talk about how i m more emotionally reserved and that he won t really see me in a bad mood for a while if at all my therapy is writing he says he wants to see so i let him read yesterday knowing it was harsh but probably something that would be good for him us if nothing else its me how i think what i can show him about myself he likes it like really really likes it gushing almost i m embarrassed by the flattery i ve never had anyone like my writing and explain to me why its good he does all that and i m just without words to say thanks doesn t begin to explain it i m kind of floored by how much he likes it says i make him want to write that he s even more attracted to me because of it so maybe i should take myself more seriously he says one day i d be a great writer if i chose to do so we then talk about his relationship with joy that burdensome heavy weighty behomoth that puts a gray cast over all we do looming always there ticking time bomb it s not going to go away so we he just has to learn how to cope make the best of it and i have decide if that s something i can live with we stay up till 1 watching the mj funeral that dvr d john mayer did the best by far it was all very strange how people mourned him like he was super human then to bed where we fooled around but ultimately decided to go to bed with no condoms in sight we wake up and part ways he for the gym me for i don t know i m at home he wants to go to the beach so i get all excited looking into trains and stuff then he changes his mind no gym no beach cloisters instead i m a lil annoyed cause i was hype for the beach but decide to make the cloisters fun anyway stop by crowded ass pathmark to pick up some picnic food then meet him at his apt prep the food and get on the m4 bus bound for the cloisters it s a small hilly park my bag is heavy my jeans why was i wearing jeans are tight and i m not feeling it we find an uneven plot of land on which to sit and eat i make hummus tomato cucumber avocado sandwiches and the pigeons squirrels and ground hogs circle with envy they are good we sit in the sun and shade not really talking my mood is off today i m feeling insecure about me us and i want him to take my face into his hands and say all the sweet things that always make me feel better but he falls asleep avocado has that effect on him i guess i try to sleep as well but the animals are too mischeivious the park too shaded and secluded i worry so we re up again walking through the garden stopping to admire all the many fast and exotic cars speeding along the henry hudson parkway he wants that life i worry some more maybe he s too bougie maybe once he starts working we ll want different things that money and material things matters too much to him it won t work it won t work i think so we re walking and i am as silent as i can be he senses it i say i need to think then we ll talk i know i m in panic mode so we begin the long walk from the cloisters to his apt stopping at a wine shop where i feel super dumb because he has all these great and intelligent things to say about wine and i don t then i feel like i ve been put on the spot because he tells me to tell the man what i want and all i want to do is crawl into my turtle s shell and hide until this is all over i feel dumb he buys 3 bottles and we make the long quiet walk home through inwood back at the apartment i confess i feel like he wants a different life a bougie life he very calmly tells me i m judgemental he s right i just panic per usual but we talk it out and then sit in the kitchen as he explains more things about wine with me and suddenly i don t feel so dumb because really all i wanted needed was knowledge his roommates come in drunk and they talk wine more about roses and table wines i m buzzed then on the 3 way with mom and kamillah who go on and on about stuff i don t care about we re trying to have sex and then we are candles are lit music is playing it feels a little tight but we figure it out it hasn t yet begun to feel good plus my buzz is waning and as usual i shouldn t be having sex on a full stomach but i like to watch him above me moving saying my name moaning he comes on me and then we sleep fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck bilal s singing when will you call and i m wondering the same thing fuck this is why i don t get close to people cause my little heart s so small so powerless to the whims of crazy things like phone calls and tones of voice or absence when you go from being on my radar all day every day to no where to be found my barometric pressure drops i m disoriented and i m not sure which way is up i don t know why i anticipate bad things why when the littlest ping will put me in evacuation mode and i m fast at work cleaning tidying stream lining my emotions pack it all up move it all out reinforce the barriers i cannot find you and it s driving me insane the last i saw you was 9am this morning you turning and mitten waving through the dingy window as the one train speeded you downtown to the gym i almost almost sculpted my day around you but then i said fuck it i m sleepy and laid down for a much needed nap you had awoken me at 5am dick rubbing between my legs then the soft rhythmic clapping of our flesh as you pressed me down into the mattress and moaned my name i do it for you my body and mind have not attuned to what i want what i need so i just enjoy watching you enjoy it and wait for you to snatch the condom off and pour it all out on my back my life is not my life these days i have nothing consistent to hold on to ejected from my job choir daily routine i favor an apartment in washington heights more than my own and rarely venture further that 135th by myself today was the first time on the 3 headed downtown i glimpse my old life the commute the solitary rides to someplace with a purpose and more importantly a paycheck now i m headed downtown to buy condoms hummus with tahini and wild caught chilean sea bass because when i like you i make it all about you i cook for you you like organic organic you will get but then you don t answer you phone don t return my text and i m stuck bearing down for the worse you went to see your son maybe love was rekindled and right now you re in her arms in her bed ignoring my call knowing that that chapter is over and you re back where you want to be maybe or maybe your body has been twisted by metal and you lay prone in a stiff bed under the harsh glow of hospital halogens dying maybe or maybe i don t know maybe i should try to think of something good like you won the lotto you re getting your dream job you and the ex and resolving all old and bad feelings so you can pack that situation away and we can get along with life with each other maybe my period s just coming pmsing always makes me crazy and though i ve been spoting and my body s doing all sorts of weird things maybe next week when the blood finally comes down i can get a better perspective and just look back on this and laugh 6 23 no call no text did you quit 6 28 hey sorry ringer has been off in bkyln w max will call soon ringer off why maybe i should just leave it all alone get some dogs move far far far far away from people who will disappoint always disappoint i do something nice 22 worth of wild caught chilean sea bass for nothing i should know better by now i m fucked forever and always i didn t want to sit here and write this after all if i don t write it it didn t exist right and i wonder how much of this i m responsible for perhaps i covered my ears too tightly hummed to loudly to hear god direct me otherwise or maybe my own negativity and pessimism strung the stones around the neck of this sinking situation either way you cannot make this shit up it s almost implausible so around 7pm he comes over i m just sitting down to eat coincidentally byron called earlier perhaps it s a sign to explore new avenues in he comes and i have no kiss for his lips i am annoyed my lovely 22 chilean sea bass sits cold and marinating in the fridge instead of digesting in his stomach he is different as well there is something to be said so he suggests going to society on the way he is figety impatient i am annoyed by his impatience and mentally make note to tell him so later we instead opt for sette panni i d never been it s ok but not as cozy as society i tell him to talk and he immediately covers his face oh shit he wants to wait until his cappuccino comes it is bad will i be mad did you have sex with her no no not that well good i think then comes the preamble long and sweeping fully of disclaimers and intentions and explanations and plausible outcomes and options weighed and so much shit i don t remember all i think is fuck just say it she is pregnant his ex girlfriend this girl who has weighed so heavily in all our interaction this joy less joy is pregnant with his second child from a night that happened 2 and a half months ago i am floored floored i want to puke scream run cry laugh hysterically because i saw this all happen on the game last season because this isn t my life more and more everyday my life morphs into something i did not see could not imagine did not want i did not want to lose my virginity to a man who i wasn t in a relationship with who had 1 baby and one on the way this isn t how it was supposed to happen so i sit quietly as he explains not wanting to give up the baby but not necessarily wanting to keep it too and how she doesn t know what she wants to do but she s not happy won t be happy and there s a doctor s appointment next week and perhaps there will be no baby and we can put all this behind us none of this consoles me i don t know how to feel what to say so i stare at the floor and corner of the table my coffee cup my hands granules of sugar anything but his face i can t see it can t feel it just yet my mouth is dry my heart is racing my clair tastes like dust and i don t know how the fuck i ended up here i didn t know it was going to end like this but i know i can t go on can t pretend that it s ok you have 2nd child on the way there is no room for me in this situation and honestly with your luck and sperm i want to get as far away from you as possible wash off any bad fortune you ve been so tagged with i just finished reading walter mosley s fortunate son and just like the boys in the book blessed with two different types of fortune i think that s what brian has he s incredibly fortunate but it just comes up on the other side of the coin these days so we sit and talk about it how he feels how fucked up the situation is how surreal it is at points me laughing until tears form in the corner of my eyes if you cannot laugh you will cry then there s the slow walk from 120th back to my apartment realizing that things have changed and will continue to change but maybe they re not over i feel fucked because my heart is in it in him and now i have to move it out and move on but he s in much deeper his life is so twisted beyond recognition i m strong for him because he cannot shoulder another burden he calls me amazing i just do what i need to do until i can crawl under my sheets and cry in front of my apartment building we hug multiple times knowing that once we part it will be for a while regardless of whether or not she keeps the baby things have changed i cannot continue on in this situation until the dust settles and the forms and shapes are clear beyond all the madness i fear more than him not being with me is going back to her me being some manic pixie influence in his life that helped him the learn and love and make him a better man for her he doesn t say this is entirely impossible as watching someone carry your child creates a bond you can t ignore at least not for him and so i shed a few tears at he unfairness of it all and then i pray for him in plain language i lay it out for god ask for his guidance that he will give peace i feel it not sure about him we part ways on the phone with lauren i lay it all out sweet sweet lauren has hope beyond hope says all is not lost and i should just take it day by day she says the situation is not beyond repair perhaps she s right but right now my heart cannot take anything more that what it is right now cold alone and tired i knew waking up would be rough it s like a bad taste in my mouth a stench i can t wash off all that really happened it really happened my life has been flipped on it s head for like the 6th time in the past 30 days will it settle down will i find my center and learn not to be so swayed by the whims and unpredictabilities of life i woke 8 am praying praying praying god i need you i want you guide me help me help them oh lord help us god perhaps i was just meant to be the ultimate intercessor for them for their situation i guess i m blessed to be a blessing but doggonit if it don t hurt to glimpse something you like you want to have only to be told it s not for you not yet not now maybe not even him it hurts bad sinking in my stomach rising in my throat it makes me sick yet i can t bring myself to cry maybe it s just not appropriate so i get up turn on my gospel and just sing it out try to find the joy the peace that i need so badly right now to not hurt so badly and it works for the most part i feel comforted for as long as my mouth is open and my mind is cleared of worry but then i check my monthly info and realize that i was ovulating on july 2 and we had sex on july 5 and i need to exchange my condoms for a pregnancy test i need to find my life today was a rough one besides praying i slept a lot i went to the gym tried to use my frenetic energy on the treadmill but my motivation waned and i quit around mile 2 i just wanted to go back home and go back to sleep even though i had taken an hour nap before i went to the gym i just want to sleep it s the only way to recharge my batteries awake again i head to hudson river park for a movie with jendayi and khaliah the wizard of oz i look for signs there anything to make it ok my belief that love is freedom that when you love someone you let them go i grip onto that then in the movie the wizard tells the tinman hearts aren t practical until they make them unbreakable later the tinman realizes i must have a heart because it s breaking that s how i feel just want to be alone i go up and down in mood one hour i m ok the next i just want to cry i miss him but i m unsure of what to do what to pray do i pray to make it work or pray to move on seamlessly i want him i don t want that other baby later in the night when we get home i m telling khaliah a little but not a lot keep saying kids babies it s a slip i hope i m not bringing to pass i don t want to be an impetus in her abortion but i don t want her to have that baby khaliah says i need to think about what i want what i can survive i can t survive a 9 month pregnancy i can t survive another baby it s sad but true and i don t know why my life has come to these difficult decisions i just wanted to meet someone to fall in love with and even though i m gushing to khaliah about him inside i m just sad heavy can this work will this work i want him even earlier scanning the internet trying to figure out the signs of pregnancy implantation spotting how long sperm can live i do not panic some ignorant part of me wants to be pregnant to keep him have him and i have to cuss myself out that that is not my life that is not how you get a healthy relationship you are not pregnant so stop looking to be so as far as joy i wish she weren t pregnant but whether or not she is or stays pregnant is not for me to decide and it sucks this is the first day in nearly a month i haven t talked to him text him something i figure if i can just make it to sunday make it to sunday then maybe i ll have something more concrete stable real something to hold onto until then it s lonely all i got is prayer and this journal to vent can t blow up lauren with circular conversation can t call brian he s got bigger fish to fry so i pray and sleep sleep sleep
